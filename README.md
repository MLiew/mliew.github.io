## Yingjia Liew
Hi there, my name is Yingjia Liew. I am a Master's graduate from Beihang University, majoring in Flight Vehicle Design and Engineering. My previous research focused on parameter updating for the digital satellite model. 

### Education
ðŸŽ“MEng, Flight Vehicle Design and Engineering (Astronautics), 2020-2023.  
  - Beihang University, China.

ðŸŽ“BEng, Flight Vehicle Design and Engineering (Astronautics), 2016-2020.  
 -  Beihang University, China.  


### Research Interests
- Satellite system and space system
- Space situational awareness
- Machine Learning, data mining, deep learning
- Autonomous control and navigation


### Research Experience
1. <b>Parameter Updating for Digital Satellite Model via Data Mining Approach</b>
   - Utilized text mining techniques to analyze the text similarity of the ontology-based satellite parameters obtained from web-crawled open-access journal articles.
   - Constructed a knowledge graph containing the satellite parameters and their similarity, correlation, and sensitivity
   - Updated digital satellite model parameters that are selected and grouped by utilizing graph reasoning and data mining algorithms  
2. <b>Satellite Collision Risk Analysis based on Data Mining</b>
  - Analyzed and predicted the collision risk of satellites by using data mining techniques, including clustering and classification, based on orbital data web-crawled from the CelesTrak website
  - Developed a GUI to automate the entire analysis process and generate an analysis report
